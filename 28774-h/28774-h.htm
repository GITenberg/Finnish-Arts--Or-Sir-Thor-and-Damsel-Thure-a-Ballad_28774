OR<br />
SIR THOR AND DAMSEL THURE.</h2>
<p>Sir Thor was a knight of prowess tried,<br />
The son of a king he was beside.</p>
<p>He was a knight excelled by none,<br />
At home such deeds of might he&rsquo;d done.</p>
<p>And not alone in his native home,<br />
But manhood had he displayed at Rome.</p>
<p>He faithfully served the emperor,<br />
And hatred to all his foes he bore.</p>
<p>King of Norroway was his sire,<br />
His fame spreads over the world entire.</p>
<p>He was a King both aged and grey,<br />
So he summoned his son from Rome away.</p>
<p>He summoned his son from Rome away,<br />
To help him Norway&rsquo;s land to sway.</p>
<p><!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>As soon as the tidings reached Sir Thor,<br />
He hied to the Roman Emperor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hail, Emperor Ludvig, great and brave!<br />
Thy leave to return to my sire I crave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freely shalt thou permission gain,<br />
And thy post shall vacant for thee remain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He greeted all the knightly train,<br />
They begged him quickly return again.</p>
<p>When from Rome he came to his own countrie,<br />
His father welcomed him heartilie.</p>
<p>His dear son married he fain would see,<br />
And divide with him his domain would he.</p>
<p>He envoys sends with all despatch<br />
To seek a maid with his son to match.</p>
<p>They travelled wide with unwearied mind<br />
Before his equal they could find.</p>
<p>O&rsquo;er land and sea so wide they speed,<br />
Until they reached the land of Swede.</p>
<p><!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>And when they reached the Swedish State,<br />
They found one worthy to be his mate.</p>
<p>Damsel Thura the maiden hight,<br />
In Swedish land was none so bright.</p>
<p>The loveliest maiden in all the land,<br />
Her father was high Sir Sallemand.</p>
<p>He was a noble rich and great,<br />
His equal was not in Sweden&rsquo;s State.</p>
<p>So glad to Norroway back they wend,<br />
That the matter be brought to a happy end.</p>
<p>They the tidings to their lord declare<br />
That they had found a damsel rare.</p>
<p>No fairer was in the Swede countrie,<br />
Nor in all the isles there round that be.</p>
<p>The heart of Sir Thor with joy beat loud<br />
When they described the damsel proud.</p>
<p>He spoke to his men, so gallant and stout,<br />
Who were to attend him in his rout:</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>&ldquo;We must quickly away, so ready make,<br />
I&rsquo;ve sworn an oath I dare not break,</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as the lovely rose was found,<br />
To her o&rsquo;er land and sea to bound.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hoisted their sails on the yard so high,<br />
And out of the haven away they fly.</p>
<p>So gay thence sailed they every one,<br />
To Sweden in less than a month they won.</p>
<p>The noble he steered his ship to the land,<br />
Sir Thor was the first who stepped on the sand.</p>
<p>The knight he sprang on his courser red:<br />
&ldquo;God help us now to this lovely maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As they through the land of Sweden hied,<br />
The folks received them with joy and pride.</p>
<p>To Sir Sallemand&rsquo;s house came Sir Thor on his steed,<br
/>
Erect in his sables stood the Swede.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here stand&rsquo;st thou, Sir Sallemand, gallantly
dight,<br />
Say, wilt thou house me with thee to-night?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;As one from God thou shalt welcome be,<br />
Respect and honour I pay to thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To the hall of the women Sir Thor led they,<br />
His eyes fell straight on the lovely may.</p>
<p>They washed their hands and to table went,<br />
With the music and talk were they well content.</p>
<p>And when they had feasted all so free,<br />
They cried for chess to increase their glee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Sallemand, listen to what I say,<br />
May I at chess with thy daughter play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, thou to play with her art free,<br />
Whether within or without I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young Sir Thor and Thure the maid,<br />
A game of chess at the table played.</p>
<p>The longer they played, they happier grew,<br />
Full pleased with each other were the two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, May Thure, thou lily bright,<br />
Wilt thou with thy white hand thyself to me plight?&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>&ldquo;Hear thou, Sir Thor, I tell thee plain,<br />
My faith and troth thou may&rsquo;st obtain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith and troth I would plight to thee<br />
If I knew thou would&rsquo;st be true to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May Christ destroy the dastard vile<br />
Who a noble maid would ever beguile!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gave him her troth with her hand so fair,<br />
But what she did more there was none aware.</p>
<p>From his hand a gold bracelet he unbound,<br />
And placed it the Damsel&rsquo;s arm around.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear me, May Thure,&rdquo; then said he,<br />
&ldquo;How long wilt thou tarry a maid for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will, Sir Thor, if need there be,<br />
For eighteen winters wait for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long a time thou need&rsquo;st not wait,<br />
No longer a time than winters eight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the eight winters they were o&rsquo;er<br />
The damsel began to grieve so sore.</p>
<p><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>The damsel began to grieve so sore,<br />
And briny tears from her eyes to pour.</p>
<p>A noble Duke has paid her his suit,<br />
A hero was he, on horse and on foot.</p>
<p>The Duke to her royal father said:<br />
&ldquo;Wilt give me counsel thy daughter to wed?</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she I&rsquo;ll hold, till life depart,<br />
As the only lady of my heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So rash a man was Sir Sallemand,<br />
To the Duke he promised his daughter&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give my daughter to thy good hand,<br />
She never shall go into Norroway land.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Thor shall never behold the day,<br />
That he with her shall Norway sway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Damsel Thure pined so sore,<br />
And the tears afresh down her cheeks did pour.</p>
<p>To the castle bridge she wends her way,<br />
And watches the ships in the sound that lay.</p>
<p><!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>Their sails both brown and white she viewed,<br />
And them with her fingers small she sewed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sewed like sails with these fingers of mine,<br />
Perhaps Sir Thor yonder ploughs the brine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So she lamented in piteous guise,<br />
But no one heard the maiden&rsquo;s cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To his true love each lad comes home,<br />
And why not mine across the foam?</p>
<p>&ldquo;O would to Christ I had a friend,<br />
That I to the shore a message might send.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d give him presents rich and fair,<br />
If he would in secret my message bear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Straight then answered the little foot-boy:<br />
&ldquo;Thy message I&rsquo;ll bear to the strand with
joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy he ran to the yellow sand,<br />
Sir Thor was steering his ship to the land.</p>
<p>Sir Thor was the first who stepped to shore,<br />
To him his message the foot-boy bore.</p>
<p><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>&ldquo;How speed the folk on this island, say?<br />
How speeds fair Thure, my plighted may?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O well doth she speed through heaven&rsquo;s grace,<br
/>
To-morrow her bridal will take place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s betrothed to a Duke of high degree,<br />
Live and die with her will he.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ere he shall gain my betroth&egrave;d may,<br />
I&rsquo;ll have with that Duke a bloody fray.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His cloak of sable he o&rsquo;er him throws,<br />
And unto Sir Sallemand&rsquo;s hall he goes.</p>
<p>He took the shining chess-table of gold,<br />
And into the high hall strode he bold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any man this hall within,<br />
Who at chess with me a game can win?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who a game at chess can skilfully play,<br />
And win a foreigner&rsquo;s gold away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>All then sate so hushed and still,<br />
None save May Thure would prove their skill.</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>But Damsel Thure, she answered free:<br />
&ldquo;Yes, I will at chess-table play with thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>May Thure covered her golden head,<br />
And unto her father she is sped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here thou sitt&rsquo;st and drink&rsquo;st wine from
the shell,<br />
And may I sit down at chess-table?</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the table a game of chess to play,<br />
Will help to beguile the longsome day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, by the Saints! my daughter bright,<br />
At chess thou may&rsquo;st play from now till night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At chess to play thou, my girl, art free,<br />
Whether within or without I be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereto her mother answer made,<br />
In evil arts she was deeply read:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Sir Thor the powerful have thou care,<br />
Lest he at chess-table thee ensnare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do thou with thy maids in thy bower stay,<br />
At tables of gold thou shalt not play.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>But the maid no ear to her mother lent,<br />
To play at tables away she went.</p>
<p>The first game on the board they played<br />
Was won by Thure, the lily maid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The eagle flies across the moor,<br />
He heeds but little the tempest&rsquo;s roar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All that he findeth he swalloweth,<br />
How like to a woman devoid of faith!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O do not cast such reproach at me,<br />
Remember I waited eight years for thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hear thou, Damsel, what word I say<br />
Wilt follow me now to Norroway?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll follow thee gladly to Norroway&rsquo;s
land,<br />
If I with thee can reach the strand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Damsel she was a lily flower,<br />
She followed Sir Thor to the rugged shore.</p>
<p>He took her tenderly by the waist,<br />
And on the gilt prow the Damsel placed.</p>
<p><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>Sir Thor spread his sail on the yard-arm good,<br />
And out to the open sea he stood.</p>
<p>The wind filled bravely the silken sail,<br />
The ship sprang lightly before the gale.</p>
<p>Sir Thor he waved his hat with delight,<br />
&ldquo;Bid ye, Sir Sallemand, a long good night</p>
<p>&ldquo;And tell the Duke, when he comes to wed,<br />
That Thor has taken his plighted maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A messenger swift Sir Sallemand hailed:<br />
&ldquo;Away with thy daughter Sir Thor has sailed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>To that Sir Sallemand replied:<br />
&ldquo;She was his own betrothed bride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her mother said with a grimly frown:<br />
&ldquo;They soon shall sink to the bottom down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For I will cause a storm to blow,<br />
Shall make them both to the bottom go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proud Mette and her nine witches hoar,<br />
They hurried screaming to the shore.</p>
<p><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>She waked on the sea a tempest blast,<br />
The sand from the bottom the waves upcast.</p>
<p>For seven long days, and long nights seven,<br />
Together were blended earth and heaven.</p>
<p>But all the mother could send for their hurt,<br />
With ease the daughter could avert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O woe is me, how rash my part,<br />
When I taught her all my secret art!&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was none on board that tide<br />
Who was able the ship to guide,</p>
<p>Save Damsel Thure, save her alone,<br />
And of her little pages one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thou little page, if thou&rsquo;lt stand by me,<br />
Full fairly I reward will thee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best of scarlet thou shalt don,<br />
And ride a noble horse upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will faithfully by thee stand,<br />
Until in safety we gain the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>Answers Sir Thor in the hold as he lies:<br />
&ldquo;Many suffer yet promise not in that guise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And many as brilliant promises give,<br />
Yet never perform them whilst they live.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Climb, little boy, on the mast so high,<br />
And see if to land we are drawing nigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But whether thou steppest aft or afore,<br />
Step not, I pray, on my bridegroom Thor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O lady, no more of the land I see<br />
Than the topmost bough of the good pine tree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more of the pomp of the world can I<br />
Than just the top of the oak espy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the top of a tree salute thine eyes,<br />
&rsquo;Tis time to bid my bridegroom rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Thor, arise, and stand on the prow,<br />
The Lord to the haven brings us now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She steered the vessel towards the land,<br />
Sir Thor stepped first upon the sand.</p>
<p><!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
21</span>The people of Norway thronged the shore,<br />
They welcomed so well their King, Sir Thor.</p>
<p>They welcomed and blest their King, Sir Thor,<br />
But they welcomed and blest his lady more.</p>
<p>The Damsel he took in such gallant way,<br />
He lifted her up on his courser gray.</p>
<p>He bore her to his own castle fair,<br />
Where they did dwell devoid of care.</p>
<p>His bridal with speed and with joy held he,<br />
To his own repose and to her great glee.</p>
<p>He embraced so fondly her dainty frame,<br />
The crown he gave her and Queenly name.</p>
<p>His palace she enters to wone therein,<br />
She dons the scarlet and ermine skin.</p>
<p>The scarlet she wears, and the gold-laced shoe;<br />
May every knight as Sir Thor prove true!</p>
<p>Sir Thor to his faith was steady and true,<br />
And true to her troth was the lady too.</p>

24</span>ODE<br />
FROM ANACREON</h2>
<p>The earth to drink does not disdain,<br />
The trees drink of the earth full fain.</p>
<p>Of the light air the sea drinks free,<br />
The red sun drinketh from the sea,</p>
<p>And the red sun, at pride of noon,<br />
I&rsquo;ve seen drunk up by the pale moon.</p>
<p>Then why, friend, with me prove in ire,<br />
That I to drink too feel desire?</p>
<h2><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>LINES<br />
FROM THE ITALIAN</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Repent, O repent!&rdquo; said a Friar one day<br />
To a reprobate wretch, as expiring he lay;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I came up the stairs, I was frightened to see<br />
The devil who&rsquo;s waiting to seize upon thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You saw him then truly?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Too truly,
alas!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;And under what shape?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Under that of an
ass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well!&rdquo; cried the sinner, &ldquo;I am not
afraid,<br />
You&rsquo;ve only been terrified by your own shade.&rdquo;</p>

26</span>A DRINKING SONG</h2>
<p>O how my breast is glowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine;<br />
And how my verse is flowing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In honour of the nine.</p>
<p>How vanish grief and sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine;<br />
Each thought about the morrow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Each project and design.</p>
<p>Through roseate space I&rsquo;m gliding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine;<br />
My spirit &rsquo;neath the guiding<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Bacchus, the divine.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>I crown my head with flowers<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine,<br />
And say: &ldquo;Almighty powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A quiet life be mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The air with sweets perfuming,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine,<br />
I sit with damsel blooming<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath a spreading vine.</p>
<p>No thought am I concealing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine;<br />
My bosom&rsquo;s all revealing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I sit beneath the vine.</p>
<p>My tongue I watch not over<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When I am drinking wine;<br />
My heart I all discover,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And naught within confine.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
